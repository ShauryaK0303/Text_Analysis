ever colonize outer space ? - Blackcoffer Insights Nature blessed humanity earth , a rounded globe essential necessity lies a human . Though 21st-century building Space shuttle exploring space become obvious activity human raise , inclusion Start-ups like Space dreamed reaching space coming . agree upon a fact Growth industrialization generated a humungous carbon footprint colonize outer space create a much-needed area survival . time human visualized undergone transformations , transformations starters effective a role existence age . a natural transformation like shifting tectonic plates manmade like Dumping water damaging water bodies , somehow affected usual life humans creating space humans next humans eyeing . idea Colonizing outer space emerged NASA able launch a space shuttle a heavy payload late 1990s idea didnâ€™t stir time later like eyes various articles astronauts writeup came limelight idea saw progression , space exploration a normal , companies petrified number investments kinds projects ask . things change entry PayPalâ€™s owner Elon Musk , 2002 laid stones Space , NASA providing launchpad exploration . space travel legitimate bottlenecks knowing nature outer space boost idea colonizing , one realize optimum . target company put forward themself get planet get earth safely , earlier projects due fund always subdued priority given rocket technology . Thus , unimaginable quest search space far-fetched though . 2020 find a colonizing outside space , kind emergence technologies led escalation spreading roots human existence , plan reaching outer space plays a role idea . Proper Planning , Analysing , Organising , Executing required projects successful deeper know I would like mention example Space , According wud successful sending Rockets 2022 would able colonize 2050 , achieving vision planned a total 36 times pre-launch rocket launching 2020 . already placed satellites provide basic network connectivity colonized world , planned extent targeted a profit $ 22 2025 . Already sent manned rocket successfully Elon musk plan create infrastructure going cost a regular air flight ticket lead better chances colonizing another planet . setting commercial flight started planet wud a stepping colonizing outer space . fundamental change people undergo living another planet a change gravity able near live support technical issues arise suit unless find a similar like earth change humans adjust . Aspects like Ultraviolet rays play immense role survival , rate technology expanding challenging boundaries days left find solutions aspects idea colonizing monetary terms projected building a colony space cost $ 10 Trillian countries GDP . Placing much amount getting funding highly anticipated projects tough . Elon addressed questions open Door believes cost nothing find a route colonize space costs justifiable space exploration reach heights . Also , world around water percentage comparison water less . Whereas population increasing level excitement order search things obsession innovative things never going finish . end , satisfy achieved , looking things crave achieve . order achieve planning crucial stage . searched 9 planets didnâ€™t shortlisted outcomes . according 3-decade theory ELON MUSK , seems possible . important thing survive atmospheric environment , whether suitable , order make suitable steps take maintain suitable level oxygen.Â missions everyone focusing . Finding source water , 2nd crucial thing needed survive . Apart excitement things , threats uncertainties bound happen like kind mammal could occur construction . security protection uncertainties could replicated . basic things , factors like natural habitats available , whether plants could grown . yes , types plants could survive . environment animals safe . balance nature need types animals , natural habitat , even insects things seems ignorable plays important role maintaining environmental balance . e.g.Â â€“ Ants leading predators insects , helping keep pest populations low.Â Ants move approximately amount soil earthworms , loosening soil process increasing air water movement ground.Â keep ecosystem clean dead insect carcasses aid destruction decomposition animal matter.Â , every thing contributes . Another matter concern level artificial intelligence machine learning required maintain kind requirement . current scenario , need energy run vehicle even robotics . , availability energy source energy needed . apart , heat equally important order maintain level . artificial air survive . , order remain healthy well calculation done . thinking disease , news concern antibiotics ( penicillin ) â€“ help fight infections â€“ eventually stop working . Global health organisations trying reduce use antibiotics , especially conditions arenâ€™t serious . overuse recent years theyâ€™re becoming less effective . survive without antibiotics . waysÂ dealing diseases caused bacteria isolation treated penicillin . might sound like something set firmly realm fantasy , experts private industry governments around world trying understand feasible would establish a lunar base . scientists think humans could survive comfortably . ways , minimal gravity might actually conducive life microgravity astronauts experience International Space Station . Although hasnâ€™t formally tested , experts hypothesize amount gravitational force put astronautâ€™s body moonÂ could help stem adverse effects like bone-density muscle loss space flyers experience living microgravity International Space Station . using moonâ€™s indigenous material , space agencies save cost flying pricey missions moonâ€™s surface.Â , instead stage costly missions aimed delivering oxygen necessary resources Earth , experts might able actually use material manufacture gasses needed sustain life satellite . earth , protected radioactive solar winds cosmic rays magnet known magnetosphere . space , canâ€™t rely type protection , order make protection , could take a lot yes upgraded technology could achieve . Although till approximate value project $ 10 . aim make fare equivalent normal air fare . comfortable resources , securities uncertainties , risk analysis , probability survival human factors consideration , development wonâ€™t take much time . construct a building take normally 8-9 months . totally acceptable . concern density , i.e . whether capacity much weight . type adaptable cultivation . Although converted different types cultivation help upgraded technology . order transport equipments regular basis , a amount fuel required , factors well Built propellor depo rocket landing building various infrastructure one one create a forward idea Colonizing outer space .
