technology eliminate need animal testing drug development ? - Blackcoffer Insights Imagine a speak one comprehend . kept captivity , a hardly breathe . finally selected taken , a happy moment . finally freedom sadly instead , prodded rods fed toxic substances against . thing scream vain . voice everyone gets lost noise scientific advancement . writhe pain substances take effect body , pain slowly creeps body slowly succumb , never wake again.Â Â Since time Aristotle , animals subjected various inhumane experiments sake knowledge . experiments though unethical necessary advancement science . Animal testing become important part experimenting living organisms ensure a product safe humans consume . lab animals generally subjected levels toxicity kept isolation due suffer a lot stress discomfort . Animal testing a number drawbacks : Animals human beings react differently certain substances . example , 2004 , Vioxx withdrew â€œrofexocibâ€ 80,000 people suffered heart attacks taking drug . Although drug showed effects animal testing , posed threat human beings.Â costly conduct animal testing animals need provided shelter food a period trials completed.Â Animal testing might lead a scientific breakthrough . various instances animal testing failing achieve desired result ultimately leads loss time , resources money.Â products like cosmetics essential humans therefore donâ€™t require animal testing . cosmetic industry notorious animal testing products itâ€™s a pity products arenâ€™t even launched market . things make us question . even ? possible stop cruelty without hampering growth ? advancement science , made possible donâ€™t use animals ever again.Â Â Advanced computingâ€“ availability various software programs become easier understand working a biological organism . replicate entire human body conduct various tests get generate simulations assess possible effects a chemical biological reaction . example , CADD ( Computer-aided drug design ) becoming popular stimulating whether a particular drug affects cells . cuts requirement using animals testing also reduces experimentation time researchers donâ€™t wait animals show response.Â Tissue CultureÂ â€“ Growing tissues Petri dishes vitro cells a viable alternative animal testing . Tissues cells , liver , kidney etc . taken animal kept a suitable growth medium a even a . cultures used test toxicity efficacy substances . example : eye irritancy tests , animals used experiment check substance irritating eye . animals permanently lose eyesight using a animal every time simply inhumane . Using bovine corneal organ culture corneal tissue cultured using yields result without complications . Scientists started use method test toxicity efficacy cosmetics , drugs chemical sectors.Â 3-D printingâ€“ Making complex tissue structures a single digital file astonishing . Printing tissues help carrying experiments getting results similar tissues . example Earlier animal organs , charts 3-D models used explain functioning a particular organ medical students bio-printing companies started making human tissues organs used students various medical schools understand intricacies human organs helped bringing animal experimentation a extent . bio-printed models also used researchers conduct experiments without using animals . A company working a bio-printed liver model test liver toxicity without use animals . a breakthrough bio-technology bring animal experimentation a percentage.Â Â Organ-on-a-chip methodÂ â€“ a fairly technology consists growing cells inside chips imitate structure behavior human organs . Researchers test drugs chips far cheaper humane testing animals . example , UK Company CN Bio come a system consists 10 organs a single chip tissues ranging liver brain.Micro dosing : Humans participate experiments injected one time doses constantly monitored imaging techniques gather information changes happening body . tests replace certain tests animals help removing drug compounds donâ€™t desired effect human body . example , COVID-19 tests carried human volunteers given doses vaccine kept surveillance . helped researchers removing drugs desired effect human body thus also able remove animal testing one processes . alternatives help bringing animal experimentation a extent . science progress without harming animals go rather putting excruciating pain . must protect animals much would living a world without them.Â Blackcoffer Insights 21 : Eeshan Sowmya K P , ICFAI Business School , Hyderabad
