Oil prices 2040 , impact world economy . - Blackcoffer Insights interconnected world . change one part world always lead # changes parts world well , maybe a bit later surely change seeing today‚Äôs world . Electric vehicles change seeing today‚Äôs world . advancements technology , economies getting bigger . might surpass US become a # superpower , inching towards a 15 economy 2040 competition outshine . also seeing a paradigm shift toward a multipolar world a unipolar world moving towards certain clusters world everyone wants a part clusters . rearrangements taking . a creating a better sustainable life present well future generations.¬ witnessed COP26 saw leaders top countries taking pledges create a sustainable future answer lies a safer greener planet electric vehicles occupy a huge chunk . Internal combustion engines already peaked , electric vehicles getting cheaper cheaper governments every actively pushing electric vehicles seen joint statement Cop 26 ‚ÄúAs business fleet owners operators , shared mobility platforms , work towards 100 % car fleets zero emission vehicles 2030 , earlier‚Äù . a step towards future . home a number two-wheelers three-wheelers constitutes 70 % global 80 % also a signatory statement . ¬ ¬ analyze properly- crude oil , coal , gas demanded natural resource world . it‚Äôs latest scenarios around world , it‚Äôs # better switch a safe , efficient , affordable electric vehicle . look economic aspects electric vehicles , surely improve livelihood society turn world . EVs track rise 20 % China‚Äôs total market 2025 , 6 % 2020 , 37 % EU , 11 % last . U.S. , forecast reach 10 % 2025 . also lagging . India‚Äôs EV market nascent forecast record a 2.4 % CAGR 2020 2025 . Electrification expected penetrate cars last-mile connectivity modes like two-wheelers 2030 . expected 70 % two-wheeler fleets 30 % private two-wheelers electric 2030 . passenger vehicles , 40 % fleets 15 % -20 % private cars electric time.¬ also different steps taken government like # tax exemptions , schemes like PLI , FAME , battery swapping policy . must also note estimated around 10 direct jobs created indirectly almost 50 jobs created around sector . look global picture also seeing a parity battery vehicles ICE vehicles advancements technology seeing prices batteries coming players getting involved prices estimated . a world leader , countries like a build lithium-ion batteries self-sufficient capabilities rise occasion a exporters world . Union also lagging also trying catch producing enough batteries self-sufficient 2025 . Crude oils increasing . seen a shortage gas countries mainly due Russia- Ukraine war everybody trying find alternative gas crude oil harmful it‚Äôs one reasons pollution a havoc world . One problems Crude oils oil spilling endangering species . Air pollution caused due petrol diesel vehicles also affecting planet less oil less pollution alternative drivetrains , fuel economy , shared mobility impact oil demand ; however , won‚Äôt reach net-zero 2050 without . Coal also a great contributor pollution Environmental impacts associated using coal energy source particulate emission , ground-level ozone , smog , acid rain . Coal fuel oil combustion emit fly particles atmosphere , contribute air pollution problems . Though said prices crude oil haven‚Äôt peaked yet , surely 2040 . , need foresee future alternative society though can‚Äôt reach a complete outwash oil 2050 we¬ make sure alternatives self-sufficient . Well , job opportunities also a reason consider EVs future . realize electric vehicle around 350-390 km people need stop somewhere recharge batteries least 40-50 minutes provide a time people avail restaurants explore shopping complexes . help generating employment opportunities # hubs like . also a countries like , , Union build charging stations like accelerate process EV vehicles . , paced world almost every alternative family a car public vehicles like buses trains changed electric vehicles boost economy a whole creating greater needs opportunities sectors transportation communication much a building today‚Äôs nation-building process.¬ However , talking a world greener fitter must realize understand Electric vehicles a cost planet . a huge amount electric waste concerning today‚Äôs world . might a concern world planning live . Electric vehicles batteries need rare materials easy find . Electronic waste , also known e-waste , electronic product , product containing electronic components , reached end usable life cycle . Unbeknownst consumers , electronics contain toxic substances ‚Äì therefore must handled care longer wanted needed . also negative effects soil improper disposal e-waste regular landfills places dumped illegally , heavy metals flame retardants seep directly e-waste soil , causing contamination underlying groundwater contamination crops planted nearby area future . Therefore , must also focus solely electric vehicles also kinds fuels like hydrogen fuels like ethanol generated agricultural waste . Companies play important part change . Rather making electric , try make vehicles hybrid nature . switch engines switch petrol diesel hydrogen ethanol also electric vehicles . future now‚Ä¶It‚Äôs time act ! ¬ ¬ Blackcoffer Insights 43 : Souptik Dirghangi , Nara Sinha Dutt College , University Calcutta
