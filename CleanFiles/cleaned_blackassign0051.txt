Data Analytics used halt COVID-19 Pandemic ? - Blackcoffer Insights Even though COVID-19 yet halted facing nth wave coronavirus outbreak across several countries , notably US , , . a fact Data Analytics big guns artillery fight against COVID-19 pandemic . helped us several stages outbreak , like detection outbreak , vaccine development manufacturing contact tracing , future hotspot detection . interesting applications discussed article . A lesser-known fact COVID-19 outbreak detected , , nearly 7,230 away outbreak , days issued warning . help Big Data Analytics , specifically Deep Learnings ( DL , a subset Machine Learning ) application Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) analyze text inputs traced surge pneumonia cases Wuhan province . specialty DL algorithms mimic cells called neurons identify patterns Big Data . DL-backed software used inputs , reports public health organizations , global airline ticketing data , etc . used flag unusual surges potential spreads infectious diseases . next application Big Data Analytics Research Development drugs halt COVID-19 . used analyze protein structure virus , findings significant progress vaccine development . preliminary studies , found mutate viruses HIV , a prophylactic vaccine a better proceed rather a therapy . also evidence supporting fact find kind cure , a virus mutating , happened mutations found UK , , . also assisted scientists rapidly shortlisting a set already available vaccines could effective against coronavirus . Another interesting application found selection right candidates , i.e . likely test positive testing coronavirus insufficient testing resources . method exercised Greek called project . Whenever a traveler wanted come Greece , fill a form known Passenger Locator Form ( PLF ) least 24 hours arrival , containing information origin , demographics , point , date entry , intended destination . allocated testing resources according size set passengers tested . test results , found positive , put quarantine . results sent program real-time learning . question remains made allocations , found , statistically , origin significant factors screening . Ultimately , a variety countries pairs , predict testing resources allocated entry point particular passengers a location technically called Multi-Armed Bandit ( MAB ) problem , chosen method solve problem algorithm called optimistic Gittins index . algorithm identified average 1.85x asymptomatic , infected travelers random surveillance testing , 2-4x travel . test results , found positive , put quarantine . Following collection significant data aforementioned process , a certain period , policies made categorizing separately imposing restrictions travelers specific location . presented operation 6th 1st processing around 38,500 PLFs testing average 18.5 % households entering every . mentioned applications show tip iceberg get developments watch include use Image Recognition identify covid based x-ray images , use Deep Learning predict 3-D protein structure associated COVID-19 .
