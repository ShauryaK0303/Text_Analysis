artificial intelligence affect environment - Blackcoffer Insights talk , different people different perspectives . one group people , knowledge potential , believe a novel solution problems world facing today . another group people merely threatened thought taking world . took birth Turing 1950 thought ‚ÄúCan machines think ? ‚Äù . Later 1980s , adoption ‚Äúexpert systems‚Äù companies around world , booming initiated . Initially , a matter awe everyone results achieve . AI‚Äôs growth past decades exponential transformed live , work solve challenges . made impact a wide variety areas including healthcare , education , business . , one areas highest impact made recently environment climate change . Revolutionizing Environment Climate Change ? strengthen climate predictions , enable smarter decision-making decarbonising industries building transport , work allocate renewable energy . recent years , a game-changer people , well organizations , climate change . Microsoft believes artificial intelligence , often encompassing machine learning deep learning , a ‚Äúgame-changer‚Äù climate change environmental issues . company‚Äôs ‚ÄòAI Earth‚Äô program committed $ 50 years create test applications . increasingly used manage intermittency renewable energy incorporated grid ; handle fluctuations improve energy storage well . Wind companies using get turbine‚Äôs propeller produce electricity per rotation incorporating real-time weather operational data . also improve energy efficiency scale incorporating data meters Internet Things ( internet computing devices embedded everyday objects , enabling send receive data ) forecast energy demand . Besides , artificial intelligence systems simulate potential zoning , building ordinances , plains help planning disaster preparedness . One vision a sustainable create ‚Äúurban dashboard‚Äù consisting real-time data energy water use availability , traffic weather make cities energy-efficient livable . Hotter temperatures significant impacts agriculture well . Data sensors monitor crop moisture , soil composition temperature help improve production know crops need watering . Incorporating information drones , also used monitor conditions , help increasingly automatic systems know times , spray harvest crops , diseases problems . result increased efficiency , enhanced yields , use water , fertilizer pesticides . , looks a downside ? talk effect environment climate , coin must elucidated . , apart positives discussed , usage also a downside . Last year‚Äôs World Economic Forum report showed address Earth‚Äôs environmental challenges , important manage properly . According forum experts , potential accelerate environmental degradation . use power-intensive GPUs run machine learning training already cited contributing increased C02 emissions . Although around half a century , question environmental impact ‚Äì ethical issues ‚Äì arising techniques developed decades used combination explosion data computational . advances enabled artificial intelligence , speech recognition self-driving cars , systems consume a lot generate volumes climate-changing carbon emissions . A study last found training off-the-shelf language-processing system produced 1,400 emissions ‚Äì amount produced flying one roundtrip . ways make machine learning cleaner greener , a movement called ‚ÄúGreen AI.‚Äù algorithms less power-hungry others , example , training moved remote locations get renewable sources . , however , developers companies know much machine learning experiments spewing much volumes could reduced . done ? prevent , proposition World Economic Forum report advancements ‚Äúsafe‚Äù pursued , ensure humanity developing harmful environment . Specifically , World Economic Forum said report developers ‚Äúmust incorporate health natural environment a fundamental dimension.‚Äù safeguarding against models demand consumption energy natural resources beyond sustainable , factors . a sense , programs need designed dimension environmental protection improvement mind . future development programs , also important note environmental impact creating systems . According academic study energy usage deep learning processes , creation effective might costly environment . Nearly 300,000 kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent emissions created process training a single model . basically equal emissions average cars United States . Considering negative environmental impact addition positive implications climate change crucial , moving forward . always room improvement , pioneers machine learning recently published a paper called Tackling Climate Change Machine Learning discussed a conference . Rolnick , a postdoctoral fellow University said ‚Äúcall arms‚Äù bring researchers together . paper covers areas research machine learning used , including energy production , CO2 removal , education , solar geoengineering , finance . idea build energy-efficient buildings , creating low-carbon materials , tech monitoring deforestation greener transportation sources . Artificial intelligence machine learning a medium work done us a caretaker mother earth . better forecasting climate change ? ¬ kick start already done climate informatics 2011 regulates collaboration data science climate science . covers a wide topics like improving prediction extreme events hurricanes , paleoclimatology , collecting data ice cores , climate up-down scaling impact us . ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot uncertainty , ‚Äù Monteleoni Monteleoni , a computer science professor University concludes AI/ ML models generally forecast short-term . a significant difference comes long-term forecasting . system developed Princeton 1960s . AI/ ML models developed till revolve around atmosphere , oceans , , cryosphere ice . help achieve heights amount data collected point time , compute complex climate conditions using climate modeling algorithms . showing effects extreme weather ? know climate change rise atmospheric temperature proof , make realistic , Montreal Institute Learning Algorithms ( ) , Microsoft ConscientAI Labs uses Generative Adversarial Networks popularly know GANs simulate mother earth look like rising levels , atmospheric temperature , air pollution intensive . ‚ÄúOur goal convince people climate change , it‚Äôs get people believe , ‚Äù said , a co-author paper Ph.D. candidate project deployed people look places look like future a significant climate change . track carbon emissions ? answer , yes . Tracking carbon emission one agendas . 2020 , UN‚Äôs goal prevent coal plants built . Satellite images come picture using deep learning techniques , data science researchers analyze quality satellite images track emission . Google expanding horizon nonprofit‚Äôs satellite imagery , including gas-powered plants emissions used researchers track pollution . countries organizations govern CO2 emission ground level data unreachable global monitoring associations . automate analysis images plants get regular updates emissions . also introduces ways measure a plant‚Äôs impact , crunching nearby infrastructure electricity use . That‚Äôs beneficial gas-powered plants don‚Äôt easy-to-measure plumes coal-powered plants . Blackcoffer Insights 19 : Shivendra Agarwal & ( University , Bangalore )
