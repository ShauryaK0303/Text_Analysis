A.I . defined internet simply â€˜simulation human intelligence machines programmed think like humans mimic actionsâ€™ . translates , work a human 100 % accuracy.In definition I would define A.I . god form human beings . question arises , A.I . entails future ? A.I . fancy enough continue existing minds time , come certain limitations threats a cause a peaceful sleep workers . introduction different areas workplace , clear half human jobs would taken A.I . would arise a need jobs humans upcoming AI-based ventures different industries . Thereby giving us share us . a survey , found believed devastating humans professionals tech-savvy people believed inculcating technology business lives would a remarkable step lead flourishment business future give a competitive rivals . People believed advanced technologies would come together work humans , produce a smarter strategic decision productive collaborative practices . modern technology prevailing organization lead stress reduction produce satisfying results thereby making organization efficient . Organizations use technology responds saying managers comfortable using A.I . accustomed organizations looking forward integration higher-end technology systems , believed technology result productivity thereby making profits run . jobs today require humans working collaboration , creates a positive signal future humans would working closely technology . Beyond training developing machines , humans would working vicinity making decisions act result given machine . said advanced technology human canâ€™t remain workforce without , technology produce accurate top-notch results requires someone make delivery.e.g. , a firm , AI-based system produces results based historical data a need someone analyze communicate present data respective stakeholders whether inside outside organization . Various uses artificial intelligence technology day-to-day functions regards interactions humans : ChatbotsEmail curationA.I . powered advertisingAutomated image recognitionSelf-sufficient drivingVoice activation much . figure A represents â€˜Artificial Intelligenceâ€™ B represents â€˜Humansâ€™ Artificial intelligence know works algorithms , neural networks , deep learning analytical tools help taking analytical decisions based data provided . Whereas , humans take higher-level decisions based â€˜Intuitionâ€™ sometimes , refers gut feeling generates humans concerning situation challenge . alone canâ€™t work handle critical situations needs humans reciprocate share information stakeholders , humans alone canâ€™t anticipate much accurate fast-paced analytical solutions problems persisting situation . strength humans working synergy surprisingly beneficial advantageous organizations . ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE JOBS believed machines future would eating traditional jobs . reality seems turning otherwise . future trend shows future AI-powered technology would take jobs done humans return would produce jobs would require human interference . newer technology approaching countries proceeding towards GIG Economies , future , witness increase freelance jobs permanent labor market norms could reduce drastically . jobs today replaced transportation retail commerce sector 100 % automated future years . â€˜Amazon Goâ€™ store uses technology goes name â€˜Just walk technologyâ€™ wherein need human-induced workforce operations carried AI-powered technologies , indeed a breakthrough technology todayâ€™s world . Rather eating jobs return creating jobs future creating massive innovations thereby fueling industries thereby giving us share jobs . a lot demand placed upcoming workforce also categorized â€˜Gen Zâ€™ . expected know technology would demand . Â generations required learn skills needed survive dynamic changing environment , activities carried workers automated , demand people working office maintaining developing technology versions . Â ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CONSTRAINTS powered technology limitations makes a rigid system hold also makes a costly affair initial stage . Â predicted cost electricity a supercharged model around $ 4.6 . , super-powered purchased big firms thereby creating value net . One limitations contain biased data scientists put data create biasedness resultant output would a biased report . machines neuroscience-based technology yet enables human emotions understand complex situations a creative , tend a lack thinking rigid programmed work a single task perform a single task time . also believed exists creativity computer , matter fast-paced , intelligent . PREPARING FUTURE Business organization Businesses organizations need understand anticipate opportunities future holds need start training employees based todayâ€™s dynamic changing technology . itâ€™s unclear future holds us , anticipation could benefit us several ways . unclear future looks like , need think probable terms could turn employ specific training programs employees organization.The training employees needed done a continuous lifetime basis education wonâ€™t limited PG degrees a lifetime process learning . Covid-19 changed scenario work patterns around world , need think strategically working dynamics future look like compared pre-covid post-covid scenario . Employees playing a role transforming organizations work practices upcoming future , organizations need select recruit candidates provide practices machines make proficient area work . Policies need developed hire people retaining talent organization . needs a continuous scanning environment organizations comprehend trends assess , trends beneficial organizations , must aware prospects plan future systematically consistently . CONCLUSION lies a possibility future certain years , could machines general human intelligence would able answer deep meaningful questions asking â€˜Why curtains ? â€™ , would able clean cars , play politics tell jokes us , using deep machine learning programs level intelligence would beyond mathematical calculations us . Thatâ€™s machines future , make competitive machines , would need train impending ambiguous future ahead us . Humans machines need work synergy get beneficial satisfying results parties . Machines indeed going take away jobs , let make sleep peacefully tonight , machines arenâ€™t arriving weâ€™re retired . Â Blackcoffer Insights 28 : Utkarsh Mahatma , Ahmedabad university
