machine replace human future work ? - Blackcoffer Insights Introduction disruptive technology taking us ? Take leave , disruptive technology always creates jobs much depleted jobs . might notice certain jobs disappearing jobs jobs transform humans robots , machines , technology creating machines replace them.¬ Technology creates data analysis tools manipulate create custom scenarios using artificial intelligence ( ) , Big Data Machine Learning ( ML ) algorithms predict drive consumer behavior . Data Analytics tools , Google Analytics , others available today , , used correctly , help organizations save millions , maybe billions dollars marketing . machine replace humans ? I go , I think it‚Äôs level set constitutes¬ machines.¬ context article , machines describe computers computerized equipment , like robots , programmed learn , sometimes like humans . Occasionally Artificial Intelligence ( ) , times machine learning , times robotics . yes , technically different things . bots efficient humans specific domains growing smarter passing . really tough tasks considered difficult human . ¬ , within broad discussion related future work , totally interrelated . Factory floors deploy robots increasingly driven machine learning algorithms adjust people working alongside . A machine work efficiently abundant data information work imparted . every forward step & advancement technology , a threat proliferating , a threat replaced work front . Every passing sealing jobs humans globe . Similarly , used turn hand-drawn sketches ( done humans ) digital source code . Role Machines Companies future : Companies clearly developing robotics expertise idea technological innovations they‚Äôll able cut costsincrease efficienciesoffer value propositionsexecute business models . course , it‚Äôs machines creatives working together either . another example , Amazon employed 100,000 robots warehouses efficiently move things around increased warehouse workforce 80,000 . Humans , Amazon‚Äôs , picking packing goods robots move orders around giant warehouses , essentially cutting ‚Äúdown walking required workers , making Amazon pickers efficient less tired.‚Äù Plus , robots ‚Äúallow Amazon shelves together like cars rush-hour traffic longer need aisle space humans . greater density shelf space inventory one , better selection customers.‚Äù Machines replace humans ? next decades ( maybe sooner ) , notion work whether handled a human a virtual hinge predictability . starting today , machines manage routine humans take unpredictable ‚Äì tasks require creativity , problem-solving , flexibility . context , robotics seen a improve operations efficiency also improve quality life workers . Although obvious human factors involved a work activity impact job automation , also highly repetitive tasks‚Äîand even mechanical ones‚Äîare ideal robots . Besides greater efficiency , automation leads a risk accidents , greater control autonomy , , fewer costs organizations . Machines diligent humans ? Although artificial intelligence machine learning make us believe robots endowed superior intelligence , fact don‚Äôt yet ability learn experience respond unknowns . things stand , however much processing automatic learning a robot , doesn‚Äôt beat factors innate human . Humans a essential part process . Think delivering services a client . customer challenges routine , humans play a important role addressing issues , solving time appear , consolidating process system . Machines vs . Humans ‚Äì premium ? machines humans placed proximity , ¬ robots expensive , doesn‚Äôt apply types , especially based Robotic Process Automation ( RPA ) , development process incorporates algorithms significantly reduce costs . Moreover , think domestic robots‚Äîbe a vacuum cleaner , a lawn mower a cleaner‚Äîare increasingly part lives . level consumption robotics attained makes affordable automate tasks modern homes obtain greater control , security comfort . Machines together division humans machines clear ‚Äì I‚Äôm , machine ‚Äì boundary getting fuzzier . prosthetics fuse seamlessly bodies , making lost limbs providing additional strength , stability , resilience , seen exoskeletons donned assembly line workers . use smartphones symbiotically , integrated directly bodies ? Think a smartphone form a contact lens capable transparently delivering augmented reality images . Think sounds like science fiction ? Think . prototypes already built . , brain-computer interfaces could become seamless well , creating a synergistic relationship us . point , question knows would moot ; ask a question I know answer . Sometimes answer stored neural circuitry , time would come connection neurons web . brain‚Äôs decision process influenced ‚Äúeducated‚Äù cultural context . external factors influencing decision processes point certain situations , legitimately claim influence brains can‚Äôt accountable choices made . point I‚Äôm trying make humans symbiosis cultural environment tools ‚Äì physical conceptual ‚Äì taught use . transformation subtle . Conclusion Practically speaking , robots growing point take world start creating smarter , better robots impractical even a concern . None expected near future , a shot . you‚Äôve ATM , waited a PC boot a catastrophic failure , a game crash reach a checkpoint , understand a world machines everything perfectly right . take jobs , need able theirs‚Äô flawlessly ; , depend humans mess lives.¬ isn‚Äôt a win-or-lose situation . We‚Äôre going wind a partner smarter machines , partnership fostered augmentation technology . Machines play essential role augmentation , successful technology , fall level perception . end , revolution silent invisible . Blackcoffer Insights 29 : Swapna . G , Nivashiniya .
