Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining - difference â€œData oilâ€ become important trendline 21st century . reason advancements related data analysis . Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining data developing a staggering , become popular buzzwords days . Buzzwords originated technical terms often underlying essence ignored fashionable use mainly used impress . reason misconception amongst people . , ML , Stats , Data Mining , related analysis data often mistook one thing , thus words often used interchangeably convey one thing . ! similarity disciplines disciplines related analysis data converting data â€œinformationâ€ . academics , learning Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining , academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored , articles try explain difference . Thus , becoming primary cause confusion learners . Hence , article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines rather wandering technical definitions . difference Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining ? essential difference disciplines lies â€œaimsâ€ approach taken achieve aims . aims fieldsÂ explained detail following sections : Artificial Intelligence : aim Artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities . satisfy aim , must understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent ? answer questions found studying intelligent agents example intelligent agent found standing front a mirror ! Yes ! Humans examples intelligent entities . Thus , 1900s , researchers began exploring thought process , reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent . Mimicking human behavior became aim initial years research . setting goal , studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim Turing Test ! Turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human-level performance cognitive tasks , sufficient fool interrogator . test received criticism mimicking human behavior exactly intelligence . intelligence related working human without human , intelligence meaning ! Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Thus , mimicking human thought processes reasoning became transformed aim . Psychology philosophy also resonate aim understand human thought process . difference tries understand thought process mimic , build . collaboration resulted models Neural Networks try mimic function neurons present human . , basically , initial aim human-centered humans considered ideal intelligent agent . Concurrently , computer science developing a greater . advances computer science , experiments theories could easily tested validated . programs applied solve real-life problems , found computers performed better humans tasks really complex humans . One examples could chess-playing program . program defeated worldâ€™s chess Kasparov . incident indicated human intelligence ultimate intelligence a human would able defeat program . leads a question , human intelligence ideal intelligence ? computers became advanced , proved better humans certain complex tasks . definition intelligence related ability solve cognitive tasks problems . , rather considering nature agents , researchers began study nature intelligence . question comes test validate intelligence ? test intelligence solve cognitive problems . agent said intelligent solve a complex problem . problem-solving approach easily tested validated computers . Thus , researchers began studying ideal intelligence , selected agent validate experiments computer . , a computer problem-solving approach adopted . , human-centered approach computer , problem-solving approach aims . contributed giving valuable insights . aims important collaboratively form aim ! Machine Learning : problem-solving approach , a big challenge overcome order achieve aim . Consider example solving a math problem . cases intelligence tested problem-solving approach . Let us say math problems given solve . problem familiar problem . Consider problem . problem familiar , know solve kind problems already solved similar problems past . , comes a question , mind able solve problem ? answer , solved similar problems past , thus learned past data , solve problems , thus even havenâ€™t seen problem past , able solve similar problems . one form intelligence . Consider another given a problem solved kind problems past . solve problem , try consciously gather manipulate given information reach a certain conclusion . kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process . kind intelligence . build intelligent agents , kinds intelligence must developed agent . , reality reached point able build agents learn past data find useful information . today reached a point build agents think . type intelligence . , able implement type intelligence Machine Learning ! , domain focuses solely implementing kind intelligence fact Machine Learning . reason ML called subset ! , difference ML . Technically speaking , â€œIt study gives computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions , patterns without explicitly programmedâ€ . statement needs elaboration . essence ML related process â€œGeneralizationâ€ learning past data . Generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims . Consider humans recognize life objects . animal , easily recognize a â€œdogâ€ a â€œcatâ€ . a trivial task us ever wondered mind able ? answer Generalization ! given a picture a dog , easily recognize a picture a dog , , minds abstracted description a dog formulated a â€œconceptâ€ a dog concepts became better better learned past experiences a dog . , think dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds . generalization , come â€œinformationâ€ . , try give computers ability generalize â€œraw dataâ€ convert â€œinformationâ€ patterns trends data . Statistics : discipline concerns collection , organization , analysis , interpretation , presentation data . Statistics tries data aim explain . , study explaining data ! Statistics domains Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics . Descriptive statistics deals explanation description data thus name â€œDescriptiveâ€ statistics . tries explain much information possible , easily whole data would a complex task otherwise . Â Inferential statistics try make accurate inferences available data . use inference tasks lives . Consider a simple cooking a soup . completing recipe , taste a , , a spoonful soup check soup tastes bad . Depending upon result , make inference whole soup soup a whole , bad . Similarly , statistics , cases apply inference meaningful information . example , consider a gather whole data time-consuming costly . cases , applying inference based available introduces uncertainty . inferential statistics come help . , Â use data context uncertainty decision-making face uncertainty statistics deals . , however , whatever data , statistics tries explain data . aim resonate ML , statistics help correctly interpret data ! Data Mining : Â â€œDataâ€ , useful raw form . Consider examples sensors used industrial applications . sensors might used a manufacturing sense different properties like temperature , pressure , etc . raw data generated sensors useful unless converted a suitable form , processed , analyzed gather valuable insights , used solve a problem ! Due unique aim capturing essence datasets , gather insights , Data Mining also referred â€œKnowledge Discoveryâ€ . , Fiorina , former CEO Hewlett-Packard said , â€œThe goal turn data information information Insightâ€ . statement completely explains aim Data Mining ! Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â , difference Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining lies aims . approaches taken , help one fulfilling aims . beauty !
